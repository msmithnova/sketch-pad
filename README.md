# sketch-pad
Odin project of a sketch pad.

It has options to change the grid size in pixels and the number of boxes.

It has modes of single color, multi color and gradient.

Other options could easily include picking a default color, using images instead of colors, hiding an image behind the grid and change opacity to reveal it.

Time to move on for now.
