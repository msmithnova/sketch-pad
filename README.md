# sketch-pad
Odin project of a sketch pad.

It has options to change the grid size in pixels and the number of boxes.

It has modes of single color, multi color and gradient.

Added image reveal mode. Added options to pick color and image to use for fill.

When using image fill, the multi-color and gradient modes use random images. In single color and image reveal modes it uses selected image.

When using color fill, only multi-color mode uses random colors, color doesn't affect image reveal mode.

Did a little refactoring. Could use some more refactoring.
